    <h2>What is EMS?</h2>
    <p>
        &emsp;EMS helps organizations and residents to identify energy waste and optimize consumption, leading to reduced operational costs. 
        <br/>In today's world, energy management has become increasingly pressing because of a host of factors pertaining to individuals as well as organizations. As such energy demand has risen, leading to the growing importance of the question of how to efficiently manage energy resources.
        <br/><br/> Other Problems being solved are:
        <ul>
            <li>Lack of real-time monitoring</li>
            <li>Limited Data Analytics</li>
        </ul>
